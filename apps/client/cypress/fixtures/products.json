      "description": "The iPhone X (Roman numeral \"X\" pronounced \"ten\", also known as iPhone 10)[11][12] is a smartphone designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is part of the eleventh generation of the iPhone. Available for pre-order from October 27, 2017, it was released on November 3, 2017. The naming of the iPhone X (skipping the iPhone 9) is to mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone X used a glass and stainless-steel form factor and \"bezel-less\" design, shrinking the bezels while not having a \"chin\", unlike many Android phones. It was the first iPhone to use an OLED screen. The home button's fingerprint sensor was replaced with a new type of authentication called Face ID, which used sensors to scan the user's face to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability also enabled emojis to be animated following the user's expression (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather than the home button used in all previous iPhones. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of US$999 also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes.",
